PDF Letterhead merges two PDF documents with overlay. This, of course doesnâ€™t
work for non-transparent documents. For example, PDFs created with
Apple Pages always have a white background. We built a feature that
automatically removes the white background.

PDF Letterhead is now suitable for PDF non-transparent documents!
