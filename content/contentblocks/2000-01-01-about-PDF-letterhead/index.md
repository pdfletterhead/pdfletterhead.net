PDF Letterhead is a simple desktop app for macOS to apply your own company logo
or letterhead onto existing PDF documents.

It’s just as easy as that: simply drag en drop a background and a PDF file and email,
print or save your PDF’s with your company stationery on it.

PDF Letterhead runs on your Mac with macOS Catalina or earlier. **Currently macOS Big Sur is not supported.** <a href="/pages/big_sur_compatibilty/">We're working on a solution</a>.
